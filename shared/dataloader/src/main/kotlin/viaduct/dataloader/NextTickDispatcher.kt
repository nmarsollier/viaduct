/**
 * A custom [CoroutineDispatcher] which wraps another [CoroutineDispatcher] (most likely a built-in
 * dispatcher, such as [Dispatchers.Default] or [Dispatchers.IO]) in order to track execution of
 * coroutines within the parent context and dispatch a registered suspend block when they've all reached a
 * suspension point.
 *
 * This dispatcher is currently used to power the coroutine-native [InternalDataLoader] implementation, but could be
 * used for other use-cases in the future.
 *
 * Note: For each call stack of coroutines that the user wants to track, a new [NextTickDispatcher]
 * instance will need to be created (e.g., per request in an HTTP server or per GraphQL execution in
 * a GraphQL server). It's important to note that creating this new instance won't create a new
 * thread pool or otherwise affect the execution of the application -- managing the execution of
 * the coroutines is fully delegated to the wrapped dispatcher.
 *
 * This implementation is heavily inspired from this comment on GitHub in the GraphQL-Java project:
 * https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/issues/1198#issuecomment-560082550
 *
 * Relevant blurb from the comment:
 *
 * > General idea: Dataloaders delay execution until their dispatch() method is called. The GraphQL
 * > query execution strategy executes datafetchers concurrently as it traverses the query graph.
 * > Whenever it calls a dataloader.load() method, it suspends indefinitely (gets stuck).
 * > We want to call dispatch() only when all current coroutines are suspended.
 *
 * > Create a new CoroutineDispatcher wrapping the CommonPool (the default coroutine dispatcher -
 * > or whatever dispatcher your app is using) I call it the QueueableDispatcher. It has an atomic
 * > integer counter and a mutable list of callbacks.
 * >   1a) Override the QueueableDispatcher's "execute" method to the following:
 * >     i) increment the atomic counter, then;
 * >     ii) call the "execute" method of the wrapped inner dispatcher (CommonPool), then;
 * >     iii) decrement the atomic counter, then if it's zero, execute and remove the first callback
 * >          on the list.
 * >   1b) A nextTick() method takes a callback and adds it to the aforementioned mutable list.
 * >       You can optionally return a Deferred from it, but it's not necessary for the implementation.
 *
 * @property wrappedDispatcher the underlying delegated dispatcher
 * @property nextTickQueueDispatcher a dispatcher that handles the next tick dispatch queue itself. this should be
 *                                   different from the dispatcher that we are wrapping
 * @property nextTickExceptionHandler Exception handler for the next tick queue. This is an advanced feature -- most of
 *                                    the time exception handling for nextTick callbacks should happen within the
 *                                    callback block itself.

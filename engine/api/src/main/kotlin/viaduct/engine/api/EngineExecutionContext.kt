 * - **Request-scoped**: Once per GraphQL request
 * - **Field-scoped**: Changes during execution tree traversal (see [FieldExecutionScope])

     * This scope contains execution state that is context-sensitive based on execution depth.
     * It separates field-scoped state (which changes during tree traversal) from view-scoped
     * state (schema/code) and request-scoped state (per-request context).
     *
     * ## Context Sensitivity
     *
     * The properties in this scope vary based on where we are in the execution tree:
     * - **During root operation execution**: Contains the client query's fragments and variables
     * - **During child plan execution** (e.g., resolver RSS): Contains the
     *   child plan's fragments and variables
     *
     * This ensures that code always has the correct fragments and variables for its execution
     * context, whether resolving the root query or executing a child plan.
     *
     * ## Lifecycle
     *
     * Field scope is created per-field during execution and may be replaced as we traverse
     * into child plans. This is in contrast to:
     * - View scope: Rarely changes (only on schema/code updates)
     * - Request scope: Once per GraphQL request

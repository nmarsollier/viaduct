## Requirements

- Java 21 must be on the path or available via JAVA_HOME
- Basic familiarity with GraphQL (see [GraphQL Foundation learning materials](https://graphql.org/learn/))

## Choose Your Approach

There are two ways to set up your first Viaduct application based on your preference:

### [Quick Start - Clone Approach](clone)

Perfect if you want to get up and running quickly. Clone one of our starter applications and start building immediately.

**Best for:** Getting familiar with Viaduct quickly, exploring examples

### [Build From Scratch](from_scratch)

Build a Viaduct application from the ground up to understand how all the pieces fit together.

**Best for:** Understanding the complete structure, setting up custom projects

---

Both approaches will result in the same working application. After completing either setup path, continue to [Touring the Application](../tour) to understand the structure.

Now that you have a running Viaduct application, let's explore its structure and understand how the pieces fit together.

## Project Structure

The main elements of this application's source-code directory are:

```
build.gradle.kts
src/
   main/viaduct/schema/schema.graphqls
   main/kotlin/com/example/viadapp/ViaductApplication.kt
   main/kotlin/com/example/viadapp/resolvers/HelloWorldResolvers.kt
   ...
...
```

You can see that a Viaduct application is a Gradle project. Let's examine each key component:

## Schema Definition

**`schema.graphqls`** contains the GraphQL schema for the application. All files matching `**/*.graphqls` in that directory collectively define the schema of the application.

Here's what you'll see in the schema:

{{< codetag path="demoapps/cli-starter/src/main/viaduct/schema/schema.graphqls" tag="schema-config">}}

Viaduct itself has built-in definitions for the root GraphQL types `Query` and `Mutation` (Viaduct doesn't yet support subscriptions). Since `Query` is built-in, application code should extend it as illustrated above.

You'll notice that both fields have `@resolver` applied to them, meaning that a developer-provided function is needed to compute their respective value. **All fields of `Query` must have `@resolver` applied to them.**

## Application Entry Point

**`ViaductApplication.kt`** contains the `main` function for this command-line tool. This file has three main responsibilities:

### 1. Creating the Viaduct Engine

{{< codetag path="demoapps/cli-starter/src/main/kotlin/com/example/viadapp/ViaductApplication.kt" tag="building-viaduct">}}

This creates an instance of the Viaduct engine. The `SchemaRegistrationInfo` defines which schemas are available (in this case, our "helloworld" schema), and the `TenantRegistrationInfo` tells Viaduct where to find your resolver code.

### 2. Preparing the Query


{{< codetag path="demoapps/cli-starter/src/main/kotlin/com/example/viadapp/ViaductApplication.kt" tag="create-execution-input">}}

This creates an `ExecutionInput` that wraps the GraphQL query to be executed. It takes the query from command-line arguments, or uses a default query if none is provided.

### 3. Executing the Query


{{< codetag path="demoapps/cli-starter/src/main/kotlin/com/example/viadapp/ViaductApplication.kt" tag="viaduct-execute-operation">}}

This sends the query to the Viaduct engine and waits for the result. Viaduct uses Kotlin coroutines for asynchronous execution.

## Resolver Implementation

**`HelloWorldResolvers.kt`** contains the "application logic" for our schemaâ€”the code that defines how to resolve the fields of the schema.

Each resolver is a class that extends a generated base class and overrides the `resolve` function:

{{< codetag path="demoapps/cli-starter/src/main/kotlin/com/example/resolvers/HelloWorldResolvers.kt" tag="greeting-resolver">}}

The `@Resolver` annotation specifies which other fields this resolver depends on (in this case, none, so it's an empty string).

## Understanding the Build Configuration

At the top of `build.gradle.kts` you'll see:


{{< codetag path="demoapps/cli-starter/build.gradle.kts" tag="plugins-config">}}

You can see the two Viaduct plugins appearing here:

- **`viaduct.application`**: This plugin must be applied to the root project. It coordinates certain build processes across the entire application, including code generation.

- **`viaduct.module`**: This plugin indicates that the project contains application code (resolvers). One or more projects in your build can apply this plugin.

Viaduct applications are structured as multi-project Gradle builds. As this example shows, a Viaduct application can be as simple as a single project build, in which case both plugins are applied to that one project.
